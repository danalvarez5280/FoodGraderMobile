# FoodGraderMobile

## This is the mobile app version of my personal project while in coding school. The original app is a restaurant finding and grading app. Similar to a Yelp. However the later iterations would include a backend for users and associated 'favorites', as well as a profile page and eventually a messanger platform to unvite other users to restaurants. 

## This app will be made with the following stacks:
### - React-Native
### - Redux
### - Google Map API
### - Google Places API (potenital)
### - Zomato API
### - Yelp API (potential)
### - Health Department API (if possible)
### - Firebase (for easy log in functionality)
### - Node.js for backend server
### - Express and Knex for Node
